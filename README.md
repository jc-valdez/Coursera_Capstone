# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

## Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto - Maps are below if not visible by Github
Instructions
This notebook is set to build the code to scrape the following Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe like the one shown below:Â¶
In this project, I will be exploring, segmenting, and clustering the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto, Canada. The neighborhood data though is not readily available on the internet. For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto (link above).
All 3 tasks of scraping, cleaning, and clustering are implemented in this notebook for ease of evaluation.
Once the data is in a structured format, I will replicate the analysis similar to another dataset (New York dataset).
